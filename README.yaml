# Short description of this project
description: |-
  The `build-harness` project is to provide a centralised repository to facilitate building documentation, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.

  It's designed to work with any CI/CD

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  In your root repository of the codebase, at the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...
    ```make
    include $(shell rm -rf *build-harness)$(shell git clone "https://github.com/Callumccr/build-harness.git")
    ```
  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.
  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  One you've pulled down `build-harness`, you can run a series of make commands to perform various actions
